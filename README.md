# **Data Analysis and Predicting Student Test Scores**

This project will serve as an aid in understanding student performance based on gender, race/ethnicity, parents education level, lunch status, test prep course taken. 
I have obtained one dataset called stud.csv located in the repo as well from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams?datasetId=74977. The first notebook is geared towards exploratory data analysis and the second notebook is focused on creating a machine learning pipeline that predicts the student's math score based on the previously mentioned features.
